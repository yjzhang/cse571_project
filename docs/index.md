### Project description

Our plan is to learn a simple navigation system for a turtlebot. Using the [Dagger](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sross1/publications/Ross-AIStats11-NoRegret.pdf) learning algorithm, we hope to be able to learn a model that allows the robot to navigate a hallway and enter a door, using Kinect sensory data. The Dagger algorithm is for imitation learning in which the controls of an expert (a human, in this case) is used to train a policy for a robot.

### Goals/schedule

#### Midterm goals 

We hope to have implemented the Dagger learning algorithm and have it working in simulation for various scenarios.

1. Start working with the turtlebot, and understand how to control it and how to save data from its sensors.
2. Implement the Dagger algorithm in simple simulated scenarios. One simple scenario is a scenario where the goal is to navigate a circular path through a track.

#### End goal

We have trained the robot so that it is capable of autonomously navigating through a hallway and pass through an open doorway without hitting obstacles.
