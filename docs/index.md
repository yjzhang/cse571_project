### Project description

Our plan is to learn a simple navigation system for a turtlebot. Using the [Dagger](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sross1/publications/Ross-AIStats11-NoRegret.pdf) learning algorithm, we hope to be able to learn a model that allows the robot to navigate a hallway and enter a door, using Kinect sensory data.

### Goals/schedule

Midterm goals: We hope to have implemented a learning algorithm and have it working in simulation for various scenarios.

End goal: We have trained the robot so that it is capable of autonomously navigating through a hallway and pass through an open doorway without hitting obstacles.
