Ideas for the project:

- neural networks for reinforcement learning - ex. deep Q-learning, implement playing some game... like flappy bird... or mario... see: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.html
  - which game?
  - other methods?

- something to do with sensing - kinect?
  - RGB-D object dataset: http://rgbd-dataset.cs.washington.edu/results.html

- public transportation? mobile tracking using GPS? transportation mode detection? see: http://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/postscripts/gps-aaai-04.pdf
  - something mobile-related

- vehicle following
  - deep learning/reinforcement learning?
  - reinforcement learning for vehicle following using a simulation
  - simulation

Project summary:
1. Learning a policy for vehicle following using deep reinforcement learning. Consider two vehicles, where one is following the other. We hope to use simulations and reinforcement learning in order to learn a policy for the following vehicle, so that it can follow the leader vehicle through its path. 

Part 2:
In order to transfer the policy from simulations to reality, one thing that we can do is to convert a depth image from a stereo camera or Kinect into a something...
